# part-action-network

This project descibes the Part Action Network proposed in our paper in ICCV2017: Single Image Action Recognition using Semantic Part Actions, Zhichen Zhao, Huimin Ma and Shaodi You.

In general, the main purpose of this paper is to capture "part action" cues to improve the body action recognition. We view a body action as a combination of several part actions.

The part action set we have collected is not perfect now, if you find annotation errors or you have good ideas on how to design the set, please feel free to contact me.
